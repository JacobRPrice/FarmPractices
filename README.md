Please read this markdown file in it's entirety before proceeding. 

All scripts have been written for and tested on Mac machines; some modification may be required for use with PC or Linux/Unix systems.

If you are a Mac user who also happens to use RStudio, you may run into an issue where you exhaust your default memory limit (i.e. "R_MAX_VSIZE") while running the dada2 pipeline. If this is the case, you will need to increase that by first creating .Renviron in your home directory and then adding R_MAX_VSIZE=XGB to it; the value of "X" will vary according to your machine's specific hardware and software configuration.
